#How to install the os on the system
-keep in mind that the first boot device is the micro sd
-use PINE64 installer as flash tool

##How to install the system direclty on the microSD 
-you can install the os directly on the microSD, for example if you want to test a new os without losing the original one,
or you can install different os on different microSD so you can easily switch between them.
-Once installed keep in  mind that the loading time can be really slow.
-In order to install direcly on the microSD you can easyly download the desired image (for the right architecture and machine specs)
and then flash on the microSD using the PINE64 installer tool.
-Once flashed you can put the microSD in the PBP and follow the wizard to install it.
-If the system look stuck for a really long time you can press ESC key. Sometimes there is an issue and the screen does not refresh automatically.
-And then it's done!

##How to install the system using the microSD to EMMC way
-This is a little more triky.
-You can't just direct copy the system from the microSd to the EMMC.
-You still need to flash the os on the microSD but you need a special version of the OS
-For manjaro you need to download the EMMC version
-You can go on manjaro website, downloads, arm version, choose the version (like PBP i3),download, you got redirected to a new page,
here copy the link of the download button, paste in the address bar, remove the file name at the end.
-Find the right version, not all the version has a emmc image already builde,so find a version that have it.
-Download the EMMC image.
-Using PINE64 flash the image on the microSD.
-Put the microSD in the PBP, turn it on.
-After a while a wizard should start (if not press ESC because sometimes the refresh got stuck)
-Follow the wizard.
-When asked remove the microSD and power the PBP again
